# MHD-Boussinesq-paper

This repository contains the source code utilized to generate simulations of the Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations employing a Boussinesq conjecture to investigate the Rayleigh-Taylor instability relevant to the research paper:

- A. Piterskaya, W. Miloch, and M. Mortensen, “A global spectral-Galerkin investigation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in plasma using an MHD-Boussinesq model”

The model described in the paper has been implemented within the spectral Galerkin framework Shenfun (https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun), version 4.1.1.

To facilitate the conda installation process, kindly refer to the 'environment.yml' file, which contains a comprehensive list of dependencies required to establish a fully operational shenfun environment.
